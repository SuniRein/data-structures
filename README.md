# Introduction

This repository contains some C++ implementations of common data structures.
The implementations are simple and only for learning purposes.
Do not use them directly in your projects.

# Usage

Every implementation is in a single header file in the `include` directory.

Test files are in the `test` directory.
`xmake` is used to test the implementations.
Run `xmake build && xmake run` to run all the tests.
